# Test CI/CD Pipeline

This is a test file to verify that our GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline is working correctly.

## What should happen when this PR is created:

1. ✅ **Automated Testing**: Tests should run against Node.js 18.x and 20.x
2. ✅ **Linting**: ESLint should check code quality
3. ✅ **Build Verification**: Application should build successfully
4. ✅ **Artifact Upload**: Build files should be saved
5. ✅ **Status Checks**: All checks should pass (or show warnings)

## Expected CI/CD Workflow Steps:

- Checkout code
- Setup Node.js (18.x and 20.x matrix)
- Install dependencies with `npm ci`
- Run linting with `npm run lint:check`
- Run tests with `npm run test:ci`
- Build application with `npm run build`
- Upload build artifacts
- Upload coverage reports (if configured)
